===JUDAH===
- make sure that nothing falls through the cracks

from Chizu:
	- Verify that game results make sense
	- make passive and aggressive players have different property valuations

from Alex:
	- make the save button on the settings screen call saveProfiles() in the monopolyGUI	

===Chizu===
- Format the winner graph
- Decide whether or not to use pictures for buttons on the top
- Integrate winner data with Frances
- Ensure that timing is working correctly
- Add a button to turn on/off tooltips
- Make a board without aggregate property data for the settings page
- Talk with Frances about using property ID's vs. using profiles to say "Player 1"

from Judah:
	- add the removeAggregateButton() method
	- fix up the connection between the menubar and "those buttons"

from Frances:
	- implement the setWinnerData() method

===Frances===
- Set up the end of game flow
	- call setWinner() in the monopolyGui
- Figure out how to create AI players
- Figure out how to handle catching exceptions thrown in games
- Make sure that the "time owned" value is being calculated correctly

from Alex:
	- make sure that games, sets, and matches are saved by adding them to the profile

from Judah:
	- only average the number of houses of games when we have a monopoly on the property.
	- when AI player is playing, only 1 set is every played
	
from Chizu:
	-time owned is not updating correctly

===Alex===
- Profile persistence
- Make sure that verification data is being sent back to the server
- Properly implement timeouts server-side
- Properly implement timeouts client-side
- Make everything close properly upon shutdown
- Make sure that errors are thrown and handled properly
- make sure that setting the last request to DISPLAYGAMEDATA on line 143 of Client.java makes sense
