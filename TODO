==GENERAL QUESTIONS==
- what do we want to do about players being able to see the board before evyerone has joined?

===JUDAH===
- make sure that nothing falls through the cracks

from Chizu:
	- Verify that game results make sense
	- make passive and aggressive players have different property valuations
	- change the passive/ aggressive players? i though you said you were going to do this
	- why is the switch board menu in the board not the gui? to my knowledge the
	  board will not know when the game is finally over but the client will switch

from Frances:
	-make sure menu shows up in end of game flow

===Chizu===
- Decide whether or not to use pictures for buttons on the top
- Add a button to turn on/off tooltips
- Talk with Frances about using property ID's vs. using profiles to say "Player 1"
- Work on repainting while playing the games
- Get the graph to change size properly

from Judah:
	- subclass the color group/ railroad panels for the settings board
	- fix up the connection between the menubar and "those buttons"

Completed:
	- implement the setWinnerData() method

===Frances===
- Make sure that the "time owned" value is being calculated correctly
- Figure out how to handle catching exceptions thrown in games
- Figure out security issues ... it always says someone is cheating
-Get rid of player with most $ method in GameDataAccumulator
from Alex:
	- make sure that games, sets, and matches are saved by adding them to the profile 
	(addgame addset and addmatch methods in records)
from Judah:
	- only average the number of houses of games when we have a monopoly on the property.
