==GENERAL QUESTIONS==
- what do we want to do about players being able to see the board before evyerone has joined?
	- I think it's fine. It's just like they're on the settings screen -- Alex

===JUDAH===
	-fix record precision

===Chizu===
- Decide whether or not to use pictures for buttons on the top
- Add a button to turn on/off tooltips
	
from Judah
	-instead of displaying player numbers display profile names, as player numbers mean nothing to them: i need this information from frances

===Frances===
-double check that things handle cleanly when a game throws an exception
-comment and make things look nice
-fix test cases

from Alex:
	- talk to Alex about a small timing thing that needs to be implemented

from Judah:
	- make sure that game music turns on when game starts and game music turns off when game ends (just call playNextInGameSong() when game starts and playNextOutOfGameSong() when games ends on the monopolygui
	- when you display players at end of game, you should print profile names as player numbers mean nothing to them
	- it seems you may not be saving records after the final set (though this may not be true), I added the saveProfiles() call (that writes to file) when the createEndGame() is called in monopolygui, this may not be appropriate, in which case fix where that's called, though it should be called at the end of a game (or even better at the end of a set)
	- winner screen does not show ai players

from Chizu:

===Alex===
- Make records persistent
- Figure out good timeout time
- Remove a client when playing games times out
- Properly implement timeouts server-side
- Properly implement timeouts client-side
- Make everything close properly upon shutdown
- Make sure that errors are thrown and handled properly

from Chizu:
	- Ensure that timing is working correctly - I think we figured out why this wasn't working and we shouldn't worry about it

from Frances:
	-fix client timeouts ... they do not work for small #s of games (like 5) so I turned them off
	-i can create two games (by clicking create game in two gui's) and it will work, except for a port assignment error ...
		this doesn't seem like good behavior

from Judah
	- right now when games end the port stays in use and cannot be reused, also game crashes if we try using a port in use, i've added an error message to the create game screen and join game screens that you should display if port or host is bad
	- records also might not be saved to the right profile everytime, I played a game, got some records, and then when I relaunched they were displayed in different profiles, it was weird, 
		I'm not sure exactly what the error is but do the following experiment: run a 2 player game on 2 new profiles for 5 sets, after the game is over go to the records page and note that it should be correct, next before closing the first 2 games, you can open up a third game and look at the records, this should be the same as the other two combined, but it's not.

===============================
Completed
===============================

Chizu:
	- implement the setWinnerData() method
	- fix up the connection between the menubar and "those buttons"
	- Format the winner graph
	- subclass the color group/ railroad panels for the settings board
	- Get the graph to change size properly
	- remove the three properties for purple and dark blue
	-weird bug where when I go on the aggressive player, the board view buttons on the board don't work, but those on the menu do
		-this actually happens somewhat more generally, i'm not sure the circumstances, but sometimes it gets into modes where only railroads switch
	-move text field on railroads to not overlap the gray part at the beginning
	-enter listener for set heuristics button?
	-remove who's winning label at beginning, or display empty graph (it is displaying an empty graph but i'll play around with it)

Frances:
	-Get rid of player with most $ method in GameDataAccumulator
	- give player names as well as numbers
	- when you display players at end of game, you should print profile names as player numbers mean nothing to them
	- only average the number of houses of games when we have a monopoly on the property.
	- make sure that games, sets, and matches are saved by adding them to the profile 
	(addgame addset and addmatch methods in records)
	-out of memory error ... AHHH 
	- Figure out security issues ... it always says someone is cheating
	-handle exceptions from Games
	-fix time owned
	-DONE but check once Alex gets ports working: make game exit cleanly when user clicks quit button in menu. just fill in the QuitListener in the InGameMenu class in the 	gameboard package
	- it seems you may not be saving records after the final set (though this may not be true),
		I added the saveProfiles() call (that writes to file) when the createEndGame() is called in monopolygui,
		this may not be appropriate, in which case fix where that's called, though it should be called at the end of a game
		(or even better at the end of a set)
