==GENERAL QUESTIONS==

===JUDAH===
- make sure that nothing falls through the cracks

from Chizu:
	- Verify that game results make sense
	- make passive and aggressive players have different property valuations
	- change the passive/ aggressive players? i though you said you were going to do this

from Frances:
	- debug the AI player (gets stuck in getPlayer())

===Chizu===
- Decide whether or not to use pictures for buttons on the top

- Talk with Frances about using property ID's vs. using profiles to say "Player 1"

from Judah:
	- subclass the color group/ railroad panels for the settings board
	- fix up the connection between the menubar and "those buttons"

Completed:
