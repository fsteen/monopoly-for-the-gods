==GENERAL QUESTIONS==
- what do we want to do about players being able to see the board before evyerone has joined?

===JUDAH===
- make sure that nothing falls through the cracks

from Chizu:
	- make passive and aggressive players have different property valuations
	- can you remove the aggregate property button from the menu for the settings page

from Frances:
	- debug the AI player (gets stuck in getPlayer())

===Chizu===
- Decide whether or not to use pictures for buttons on the top
- Add a button to turn on/off tooltips
- Talk with Frances about using property ID's vs. using profiles to say "Player 1"
- Work on repainting while playing the games?

Completed:
	- implement the setWinnerData() method
