Things to do

-/some data that i could collect but don't
	-for each property, % of the game for which each player owned said property, % of game for which it was owned
-player module data processing
-testing
-implementing different settings, i.e. the different win conditions

-how to pass around the settings object

- % of games during which you owned a certain property
- average max # of houses you had on that property
- average max # of houses on that property, in general


Concerns

-how do we decide how many data points to collect, what to do when a game doesn't have that many data points?
-should i use the already available GameData, TimeStamp, PropertyData and PlayerWealthData ?
-they are not entirely as i would like them to be:
	-values are stored as integers, not conducive to averaging
	-mortgaging is a boolean value, so i can't report back on the percentage of the time that something was mortgaged
	-reporting back on individual player data for each property as well as combined data for each property is a bit hack-y
	-there are some data fields that are absent : % of the games that a certain plater owned a property at a certain time
	
-in player module i return data without synchronizing on it,
	this should be fine since all threads should be done messing with it
	but it makes me nervous and should probably be changed
	
	
	
------------------------
TODO
-for player properties % time you owned it
-/finish creating settings object
